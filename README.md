# VideoConverter
<b>Created by Mayank Makwana and Andrew Ge</b>

<i>A web application using Microsoft's Project Oxford to convert any video to any language </i>

This project was created at HackPrinceton with the goal of bringing online education to a wider audience by converting videos in the language of the user's choice. The idea is to feed a video into our application using the link and then, based on the user's desire, a translated output is created. 
As this project was created in a span of 36 hours, there a few "bad" coding practices present.
